# Bootstrap JS for MooTools

[Bootstrap, from Twitter](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) is a heaping serving of awesomeness. In addition to it's easy to use grid system, layouts, good looking typography, and the fact that the whole thing is written in [Less](http://lesscss.org), it includes a handful of [JavaScript plugins](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html) for [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Ender](http://ender.no.de/) to bring a lot of the CSS components to life. We're talking tips, popups, drop down menus and more.

## Enter MooTools

For those of us who prefer [MooTools](http://mootools.net), the JS included in Bootstrap isn't so useful. This library offers all the tools necessary to get the same functionality released by Twitter.

## Getting the Library

Included in this repo are numerous MooTools plugins that depend on [MooTools Core](http://mootools.net/download), [MooTools More](http://mootools.net/more), [Clientcide](http://clientcide.com), [MooTools Behavior](http://github.com/anutron/behavior), and [Behaviors for MooTools More](http://github.com/anutron/more-behaviors). Building all these takes some configuration on your part (check out the [MooTools Packager](https://github.com/kamicane/packager/) - here's a [nice blog post on it by Ryan Florence](http://ryanflorence.com/packager/)), or you can just go to [dev.clientcide.com](http://dev.clientcide.com/?version=MooTools%20Bootstrap) and build it with the online tools there, which is what I recommend.

## How to Use
