# About
<p class="lead">Where did Behavior UI come from? Where is it going? How can you help?</p>

## History

Behavior UI was began as a UI kit built by Aaron Newton ([@anutron](http://github.com/anutron)) at
[Cloudera](http://cloudera.com) with the help of the rest of the team there.
[Behavior](http://github.com/anutron/behavior) was open sourced along with the rest of the
(now deprecated) [Clientcide](http://clientcide.com) JavaScript libraries written for
[MooTools](http://mootools.net).

When Aaron left Cloudera and joined [Thanx](http://thanx.com) he brought Behavior with him and
authored a MooTools version of the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) library. Thanx iterated on
this, pulling in [Flat UI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/) and adding a lot more functionality
including charts by [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/).

## Acknowledgements

Big props to the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) team of course. None of this work would be as
far along without all their hard work. You'll find many things throughtout this project, including
this very about page, inspired by their work.

Another big props to the [MooTools](http://mootools.net) team. The JavaScript here, written against
MooTools, is constantly being improved upon because the MooTools project is also constantly being
improved.

A nod to [Mark Bult](https://github.com/markbult) whose design work has influenced a lot of
the UI components here, especially the HighCharts theme work, not to mention the whole team at
[Thanx](http://thanx.com).


## Getting Involved

If you'd like to contribute, send a pull request. You can file bugs and change requests in the
[github issues](https://github.com/Behavior-UI/behavior-ui/issues). If you'd like to file a ticket,
do the following:

1. [Fork our jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/QtLZ9/) and creat an example that demonstrates the problem.
2. Always add information on what browser it applies to, and other information needed for us to debug.
3. It may be that the bug is already fixed. If you don't fork our jsFiddle (which points to the latest
   version) be sure to update.
4. File the ticket in [github issues](https://github.com/Behavior-UI/behavior-ui/issues).

If you'd like to send us a pull request, fork the repo and then:

1. Add your changes in the JS and Less libraries.
2. Create a demo in the sandbox files.
3. Run `grunt` to build all the distribution files. If your sandbox example requires assets, add them
   to the appropriate directory and update `bowers.json` to ensure they are listed.
4. Add any API documentation to the `Docs` directory.
5. Add tests as appropriate.
6. Verify your work behaves properly in all modern browsers.
7. Push to your fork, send a pull request!

Do all that and send us good work and we'll add you to the project and extend our warmest gratitude.
